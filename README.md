This program is a fully functional record database with only record id search functions.

More functions will be added in the paid version of the full release version.

As the cost of programming a custom program is very hight in hours of programming , and making sure that all functions are obtainabe in an easy to use fashion , the paid version will go for $129.95 US, this gets you a
fully searchable , workable customised version of your own recoird database.

All things considered, just about any variable in your seperate albums will be considered as a field of data
entry in the program.

Please run the Public Fully working Record Database for more information, Russ Campbell
